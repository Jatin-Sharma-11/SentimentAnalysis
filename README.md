# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis using Transformers

A deep learning-based sentiment analysis system integrating textual and visual modalities.  
Built with transformer architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT) and CNNs for accurate and context-rich opinion mining.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines textual (BERT-based) and visual (CNN-based) inputs.
- 🔍 **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**: Fine-grained analysis of sentiment per aspect.
- 🐦 **Twitter & Market Sentiment**: Analyzes public sentiment from tweets and financial posts.
- ⚙️ **Fine-Tuned Transformers**: Custom fine-tuning of BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT for domain-specific accuracy.
